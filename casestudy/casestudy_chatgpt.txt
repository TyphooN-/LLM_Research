Sure! Here's a full case study on GDPR compliance for a technology company. You can customize the company name and specifics as needed, or I can tailor it further to your preferred tech focus (e.g., SaaS, cloud storage, AI, etc.).

Case Study: GDPR Compliance Journey of TechNova Inc.

Overview
Company: TechNova Inc.
Industry: Cloud-based SaaS Platform
Location: Headquarters in the United States, with operations in the EU
Employees: 200+
Users: 1.2 million globally, 350,000 in the EU

Background
TechNova Inc. offers a cloud-based collaboration and productivity tool for businesses, enabling real-time document editing, messaging, and file storage. With rapid user growth in the European Union, the company faced increasing pressure to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on May 25, 2018.

Failure to comply could result in fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover — a major risk for a mid-sized but growing tech company.

Challenges Faced
Data Mapping and Inventory
TechNova had collected user data across multiple tools and platforms without a centralized inventory.
Shadow IT usage and legacy systems made it difficult to know where personal data was stored.
Consent Management
User consent mechanisms were outdated, often bundled into terms of service with no granular controls.
There was no simple way for users to withdraw consent or access their personal data.
Third-Party Risk
The company relied on multiple third-party services (e.g., analytics, payment processors, cloud hosting) that processed personal data.
No Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) were in place.
Data Subject Rights
TechNova lacked workflows to respond to GDPR-mandated rights such as:
Right to be forgotten
Data portability
Right to access or correct data
Security Measures
Security policies were ad hoc and lacked formal documentation.
Incident response procedures were not GDPR-compliant.
Actions Taken
1. GDPR Readiness Assessment

Hired a Data Protection Officer (DPO)
Conducted a gap analysis with an external consultancy
Created a GDPR roadmap with milestones
2. Data Inventory and Mapping

Used data discovery tools to locate personal data across cloud and on-premise systems
Classified data by type, location, purpose, and retention period
Built a data processing register as required by Article 30 of GDPR
3. Consent and Privacy Notice Overhaul

Updated privacy policy to be GDPR-compliant and user-friendly
Built a consent management platform with granular opt-ins
Added options for users to change or withdraw consent from their account dashboard
4. Third-Party Vendor Management

Audited all third-party vendors
Signed or updated Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)
Created a vendor risk matrix
5. Data Subject Rights Portal

Launched a self-service portal where users could:
Request data access
Request deletion
Download their data in a portable format
Created internal workflows to respond to these within 30 days
6. Security Enhancements

Implemented end-to-end encryption
Introduced two-factor authentication for all users
Created and tested an incident response plan
Logged and monitored access to personal data
Results
GDPR Compliance Achieved: Within 9 months, TechNova declared full GDPR compliance.
Risk Mitigation: Avoided fines during a random audit by the Irish Data Protection Commission.
User Trust: Saw a 20% increase in user trust scores in EU markets (measured via NPS and CSAT surveys).
Operational Efficiency: Reduced customer support overhead by 40% through self-service privacy tools.
Lessons Learned
Start Early: GDPR compliance is complex; early planning saved TechNova from legal exposure.
Cross-Functional Collaboration: Legal, IT, Product, and Marketing teams all played crucial roles.
Transparency Pays Off: Clear communication about data practices improved brand reputation.
Compliance is Continuous: Ongoing vendor reviews, audits, and policy updates are now part of TechNova’s data governance model.
Conclusion
TechNova's GDPR compliance journey was not just a legal necessity but a business enabler. By embedding privacy into product design and operations, the company turned compliance into a competitive advantage, especially in privacy-conscious European markets.
