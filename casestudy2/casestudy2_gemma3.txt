## SOC Reports: A Comprehensive Guide & Templates for Audit & Assessment

This document provides a detailed overview of SOC reports, including explanations of each type, when to use them, and detailed templates and checklists for each.

**Understanding SOC Reports**

SOC (System and Organization Controls) reports are audits that provide assurance about a service organization's controls relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). They are created in accordance with the AICPA's (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) Trust 
Services Criteria.  These criteria cover five principles:

* **Security:** Protection against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of user data.
* **Availability:** Ensuring the system is available for operation and use as agreed.
* **Processing Integrity:** System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized.
* **Confidentiality:** Protecting information designated as confidential.
* **Privacy:** Protecting personal information collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of in conformity with the commitments in the organization’s privacy notice.

**SOC Types Explained & When to Use Them**

There are three main types of SOC reports:

* **SOC 1:** Focuses on controls relevant to *user entities' internal control over financial reporting (ICFR)*.  This is for service organizations that process financial data or impact their customers' financial reporting.
    * **When to Use:**  If your service organization handles financial data (e.g., payroll processing, loan servicing, data hosting impacting financial statements) and your customers need assurance about the controls over that data.  Often requested by auditors of user entities.
    * **Types of SOC 1 Reports:**
        * **SOC 1 Type I:**  Describes the service organization's controls as of a specific date.  A "snapshot" in time.
        * **SOC 1 Type II:**  Describes the service organization's controls over a period of time (typically 6-12 months) and includes testing of the effectiveness of those controls.  Provides a higher level of assurance.

* **SOC 2:** Focuses on controls relevant to *security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy*.  This is for service organizations that store, process, or transmit customer data.
    * **When to Use:**  If your service organization handles sensitive customer data (e.g., SaaS providers, cloud storage, data analytics) and your customers need assurance about the security and reliability of your systems.  Becoming increasingly common for SaaS companies.
    * **Types of SOC 2 Reports:**
        * **SOC 2 Type I:**  Describes the service organization's controls as of a specific date.
        * **SOC 2 Type II:**  Describes the service organization's controls over a period of time and includes testing of the effectiveness of those controls.

* **SOC 3:**  A general-purpose report that is publicly available. It's a summary of a SOC 2 report and doesn't include detailed information about the controls.
    * **When to Use:**  For marketing purposes to demonstrate a commitment to security and reliability.  It's a less detailed report and doesn't satisfy the requirements of user entity auditors.

## SOC 3 Report

A SOC 3 report is a summary of a SOC 2 Type II report. It's publicly available and doesn't include the detailed information about the controls.  It typically includes:

*   **Summary of the Controls**
*   **Independent Accountant's Report** (a simplified version of the Type II report)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Customization:** These templates and checklists are examples. You *must* customize them to reflect your specific environment, services, and risks.
