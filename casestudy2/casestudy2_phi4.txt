>>> Create for me a detailed SOC template for an audit and assessment, include a detailed explanation of what each SOC type is, when each SOC type should be used, and then give me the template and checklist for each type
Creating a Service Organization Control (SOC) report template involves understanding the different types of SOC reports available and their purposes. The two main categories are SOC 1 and SOC 2, with SOC 3 being a publicly available version of SOC 2. Each type serves specific needs based on the services 
provided by an organization.

### Understanding SOC Types

#### SOC 1
**Purpose:** 
- Focuses on financial reporting controls.
- Designed for service organizations that impact their clients' internal control over financial reporting (ICFR).

**When to Use:**
- When a service provider's operations could affect a client’s financial statements.
- Required by auditors assessing the ICFR of their clients.

#### SOC 2
**Purpose:** 
- Addresses controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy (the "trust services criteria").

**When to Use:**
- When a service provider handles customer data and wants to demonstrate robustness in managing data.
- Suitable for IT service providers, cloud computing services, SaaS companies, etc.

#### SOC 3
**Purpose:** 
- A publicly available version of SOC 2 with limited information on the report's findings.
- Provides assurance that controls are in place but does not disclose specific details about controls and tests performed.

**When to Use:**
- For providing general users or stakeholders with an overview of the service organization’s control environment without detailed internal specifics.
