 **SOC (System and Organization Controls) Overview**

There are three types of SOC reports: SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3. Each report focuses on different aspects of an organization's controls, and they are used in various situations based on the needs of users and stakeholders.

1. **SOC 1 Report** - This report is focused on internal controls relevant to financial reporting (ICFR). It provides assurance that the control environment related to financial reporting is suitably designed and operating effectively. SOC 1 reports are used by auditors, management, and users who need an 
understanding of the service organization's controls that impact their financial statements.

2. **SOC 2 Report** - This report evaluates a service provider's non-financial reporting controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy as they are relevant to the services provided. SOC 2 reports are intended for users who need an understanding of the controls at 
a service organization that impact their systems and data.

3. **SOC 3 Report** - This report is similar in scope to a SOC 2 report but provides a simplified, condensed version of the results in the form of a general-use report. It can be freely distributed or posted on websites as it doesn't contain sensitive information about controls.

**When to use each SOC type:**

1. **SOC 1 Report**: Use this report when your organization needs assurance that the service provider's controls related to financial reporting are suitably designed and operating effectively. This is typically used by companies offering outsourced services like payroll processing, data hosting, or other 
IT-related services.

2. **SOC 2 Report**: Use this report if your organization provides non-financial information system services that store, process, or transmit sensitive customer data. A SOC 2 report will provide assurance to stakeholders about the effectiveness of controls related to security, availability, processing 
integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

3. **SOC 3 Report**: Use this report if you need a general-use report that provides assurance regarding your organization's internal controls over its systems and data but does not contain sensitive information. This type of report is often used for marketing purposes or to provide high-level assurances to 
customers without disclosing detailed control information.
