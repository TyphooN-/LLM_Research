# SOC (System and Organization Controls) Audit and Assessment Templates

The SOC (System and Organization Controls) reporting framework is designed to help service organizations demonstrate their internal controls' effectiveness to customers and stakeholders. Developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), SOC reports provide assurance about the 
security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system. There are three main types of SOC reports: SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3. Below is a detailed explanation of each type, when to use them, and templates with checklists for each.

---

## **SOC 1 (SSAE 18 / ISAE 3402)**  
**What it is:**  
SOC 1 reports focus on controls at a service organization that are relevant to a user entity's internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). It is based on the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 (SSAE 18) or International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3402 (ISAE 3402).  

**When to use it:**  
Use SOC 1 when your service organization’s controls impact a client’s financial reporting. It is typically required for organizations that process financial transactions on behalf of their clients, such as payroll processors, loan servicers, or data centers.  

**Types:**  
- **Type 1**: Reports on the design of controls at a specific point in time.  
- **Type 2**: Reports on the design and operating effectiveness of controls over a period (usually 6–12 months).
