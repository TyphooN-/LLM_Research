>>> Create for me a detailed SOC template for an audit and assessment, include a detailed explanation of what each SOC type is, when each SOC type should be used, and then give me the template and checklist for each type
Before I provide you with the detailed templates and checklists for SOC (System and Organization Controls) audits, it's important to understand the different types of SOC reports.

**SOC 1:**
- **Explanation:** A SOC 1 report is focused on financial reporting controls. It evaluates the internal controls relevant to an organization’s system that may impact a user entity’s financial statements.
- **Usage:** This type should be used by service organizations whose operations could affect their clients’ financial reporting.

**SOC 2:**
- **Explanation:** A SOC 2 report focuses on non-financial reporting controls related to the Trust Services Criteria (TSC): security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
- **Usage:** This type should be used by organizations that handle sensitive data or information technology services, where assurance over these five TSCs is required.

**SOC 3:**
- **Explanation:** Similar to SOC 2 but designed for a general audience. It provides a high-level overview of the controls without detailing specific testing results and is suitable for marketing purposes.
- **Usage:** This type should be used when an organization wants to publicly display their commitment to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

Now let's create simplified templates and checklists for each SOC type. Please note that these are simplified versions; actual SOC audit reports require a much more detailed approach and involve working closely with auditors.
