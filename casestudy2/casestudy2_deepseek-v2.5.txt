### Introduction to System and Organization Controls (SOC) Audits

System and Organization Controls (SOC) audits are designed to provide assurance over an organization's internal controls related to financial reporting, operational processes, and compliance with various regulations. There are three primary types of SOC reports:

1. **Type 1: SOC 1**
   - **Description**: This report focuses on the internal controls relevant to financial reporting (ICFR) as defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It is often used by service organizations that provide services impacting their clients' financial statements.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for service providers like payroll processors, billing services, and data centers where the accuracy of financial transactions is critical.

2. **Type 2: SOC 2**
   - **Description**: This report evaluates an organization’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy based on the AICPA's Trust Services Criteria (TSC). It provides a detailed view of how these controls are implemented over time.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for organizations that handle sensitive data or provide services that require trust from their customers, such as cloud service providers, SaaS companies, and healthcare institutions.

3. **Type 3: SOC 3**
   - **Description**: This report is a simplified version of the SOC 2 report and can be freely distributed. It provides an overview of the controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy but without detailed testing over time.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for marketing purposes where customers want a quick assurance that a service provider meets basic trust criteria.
