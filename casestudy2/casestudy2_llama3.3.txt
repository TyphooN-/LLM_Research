>>> Create for me a detailed SOC template for an audit and assessment, include a detailed explanation of what each SOC type is, when each SOC type should be used, and then give me the template and checklist for each type
Here is a detailed SOC (Service Organization Control) template for an audit and assessment, along with explanations of each SOC type, when to use them, and checklists for each.

**Introduction to SOC**

A Service Organization Control (SOC) report is an independent auditor's examination of a service organization's controls related to one or more Trust Services Criteria (TSC). The TSC are a set of principles used to evaluate the suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls at a service 
organization. There are three types of SOC reports: SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3.

**SOC Types**

### SOC 1

* **Definition:** A SOC 1 report is an examination of a service organization's internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR).
* **Purpose:** The purpose of a SOC 1 report is to provide assurance that the service organization's ICFR are suitably designed and operating effectively.
* **When to use:** A SOC 1 report is typically used by organizations that provide services that impact their customers' financial statements, such as:
	+ Financial institutions
	+ Insurance companies
	+ Investment firms
	+ Payroll processing companies
* **Key components:**
	+ Management's description of the service organization's system and controls
	+ Auditor's opinion on the fairness of management's description and the operating effectiveness of the controls

### SOC 2

* **Definition:** A SOC 2 report is an examination of a service organization's controls related to one or more Trust Services Criteria (TSC).
* **Purpose:** The purpose of a SOC 2 report is to provide assurance that the service organization's controls are suitably designed and operating effectively to achieve one or more of the following TSC:
	+ Security
	+ Availability
	+ Processing Integrity
	+ Confidentiality
	+ Privacy
* **When to use:** A SOC 2 report is typically used by organizations that provide services that require a high level of trust, such as:
	+ Cloud computing providers
	+ Data centers
	+ Software as a Service (SaaS) providers
	+ Managed security service providers
* **Key components:**
	+ Management's description of the service organization's system and controls
	+ Auditor's opinion on the fairness of management's description and the operating effectiveness of the controls

### SOC 3

* **Definition:** A SOC 3 report is a general-use report that provides a high-level overview of a service organization's controls related to one or more TSC.
* **Purpose:** The purpose of a SOC 3 report is to provide assurance that the service organization's controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, but with less detail than a SOC 2 report.
* **When to use:** A SOC 3 report is typically used by organizations that want to provide a high-level overview of their controls to a wide range of stakeholders, such as:
	+ Marketing materials
	+ Website content
	+ General customer inquiries
* **Key components:**
	+ Management's assertion about the service organization's system and controls
	+ Auditor's opinion on the fairness of management's assertion
