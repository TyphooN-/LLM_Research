### Introduction to Security Operations Center (SOC) Types

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level. SOCs are typically staffed by security analysts who monitor, detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. There are several types of SOC environments, each designed for 
different levels of complexity, risk, and scale. Understanding these differences helps in choosing the right type for your organization's needs.

1. **Type 1: Basic SOC (SOC-Lite)**
   - **Description**: This is an entry-level SOC primarily focused on monitoring and alerting based on predefined rules or signatures. It typically includes a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to aggregate logs from various sources.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for small organizations with limited resources, where the focus is on basic threat detection and response capabilities.
   
2. **Type 2: Intermediate SOC**
   - **Description**: This level of SOC builds upon Type 1 by adding more advanced analytics, correlation rules, and automated response actions. It also includes some degree of incident investigation and forensics capabilities.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for mid-sized organizations that require a balance between cost and sophistication in their security operations.
   
3. **Type 3: Advanced SOC**
   - **Description**: An advanced SOC incorporates machine learning, artificial intelligence, and threat hunting to proactively identify threats. It includes dedicated teams for incident response, forensics, and vulnerability management.
   - **Use Case**: Recommended for large enterprises with high-security needs, such as financial institutions or government agencies.
   
4. **Type 4: Managed SOC (MSSP)**
   - **Description**: In a managed SOC scenario, an external provider handles the security operations on behalf of the organization. This includes continuous monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for organizations that lack in-house expertise or prefer to outsource their security operations.
   
5. **Type 5: Hybrid SOC**
   - **Description**: A hybrid SOC combines elements of both internal and managed services. It leverages the strengths of an external MSSP while maintaining critical functions internally, such as incident response and strategic planning.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for organizations that want to balance control with cost-efficiency by outsourcing specific tasks while keeping others in-house.

### SOC Audit and Assessment Template

Below is a detailed template for conducting an audit and assessment of each type of SOC, including checklists tailored to the specific needs of each type.

---

#### **Type 1: Basic SOC (SOC-Lite)**

**Objective**: To assess the effectiveness of basic monitoring and alerting capabilities in a small organization.

| **Category** | **Audit Item** | **Checklist** | **Explanation** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Monitoring   | Log Aggregation | - Are logs from all critical systems being collected?<br>- Is log retention policy set (e.g., 90 days)? | Ensure comprehensive logging to detect security events. |
| Alerting     | Baseline Alerts | - Does the SIEM generate alerts based on predefined rules?<br>- Are these alerts reviewed regularly? | Basic threat detection through rule-based alerts. |
| Incident Response | Basic IR Plan | - Is there a documented incident response plan?<br>- Do staff know their roles in an incident? | Simple, but effective response to incidents. |
| Tools        | SIEM/Log Management | - Is the SIEM configured correctly?<br>- Are log sources fully integrated? | Essential tools for monitoring and alerting. |

---

#### **Type 2: Intermediate SOC**

**Objective**: To evaluate the sophistication of analytics, correlation rules, and automated response actions in a mid-sized organization.

| **Category** | **Audit Item** | **Checklist** | **Explanation** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Monitoring   | Advanced Analytics | - Are advanced analytics (e.g., anomaly detection) enabled?<br>- Do these analytics improve threat detection? | More sophisticated monitoring beyond basic alerts. |
| Alerting     | Correlation Rules | - Are correlation rules in place for multi-source events?<br>- How often are these rules updated? | Enhanced threat detection through event correlation. |
| Incident Response | Automated Responses | - Are automated responses configured (e.g., blocking IPs)?<br>- Do these actions reduce response time? | Quick mitigation of threats through automation. |
| Tools        | SIEM/Log Management + Automation | - Is the SIEM integrated with automation tools?<br>- Are these tools effectively reducing workload? | Sophisticated tools for monitoring and automated responses. |

---

#### **Type 3: Advanced SOC**

**Objective**: To assess the capabilities of machine learning, threat hunting, and dedicated response teams in a large enterprise.

| **Category** | **Audit Item** | **Checklist** | **Explanation** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Monitoring   | Machine Learning | - Are ML models used for threat detection?<br>- How often are these models retrained? | Proactive threat detection through AI. |
| Alerting     | Threat Hunting | - Is there a dedicated team for threat hunting?<br>- Do they regularly identify new threats? | Active search for unknown threats. |
| Incident Response | Dedicated Teams | - Are teams specialized (e.g., forensics, vulnerability)?<br>- How well do these teams collaborate? | Expertise in various areas of incident response. |
| Tools        | Advanced SIEM/Automation + Forensic Tools | - Is the SIEM integrated with forensic tools?<br>- Do these tools enhance investigation capabilities? | Cutting-edge tools for advanced threat detection and response. |

---

#### **Type 4: Managed SOC (MSSP)**

**Objective**: To evaluate the effectiveness of an external provider in managing security operations on behalf of the organization.

| **Category** | **Audit Item** | **Checklist** | **Explanation** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Monitoring   | External SIEM | - Is the MSSP's SIEM fully integrated with your systems?<br>- How often is data synchronized? | Ensure continuous monitoring by an external expert. |
| Alerting     | Managed Alerts | - Are alerts managed and reviewed by the MSSP?<br>- Do they provide regular reports on activity? | Outsourced threat detection and alert management. |
| Incident Response | External IR Team | - Does the MSSP have a dedicated incident response team?<br>- How quickly do they respond to incidents? | Fast and expert-level response through external teams. |
| Tools        | Managed Security Tools | - Are all necessary tools provided by the MSSP?<br>- How often are these tools updated? | Comprehensive security toolset managed externally. |

---

#### **Type 5: Hybrid SOC**

**Objective**: To assess the balance between internal and external resources in managing security operations.

| **Category** | **Audit Item** | **Checklist** | **Explanation** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Monitoring   | Combined SIEM | - Is your internal SIEM integrated with the MSSP's?<br>- How is data shared and managed? | Dual monitoring for comprehensive coverage. |
| Alerting     | Shared Alerts | - Are alerts from both sources consolidated?<br>- How are conflicts resolved? | Unified alert management across internal and external teams. |
